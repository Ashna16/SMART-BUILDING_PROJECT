Here This code uses the wiringPi library, a library for controlling the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. 
The LIGHT_PIN and MOTION_SENSOR_PIN constants are defined as the pin numbers that the light and motion sensor are connected to, respectively.

The code sets the LIGHT_PIN as an output and MOTION_SENSOR_PIN as an input. 
Then it runs an infinite loop that checks the state of the motion sensor every iteration. 
If the sensor detects motion, it will turn the light on by setting the LIGHT_PIN to high, otherwise it will turn the light off by setting the 
LIGHT_PIN to low.
