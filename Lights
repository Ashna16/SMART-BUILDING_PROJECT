This code uses the Arduino's digitalRead() and digitalWrite() functions to read the state of the motion sensor and turn the light on or off accordingly. 
The lightPin and motionSensorPin constants are defined as the pin numbers that the light and motion sensor are connected to, respectively.

The setup() function is called once at the beginning of the program and it sets the lightPin and motionSensorPin as output and input respectively.
The loop() function is called continuously and it reads the state of the motion sensor every iteration. 
If the sensor detects motion, it will turn the light on by setting the lightPin to high, otherwise it will turn the light off 
by setting the lightPin to low.
