This code uses the Arduino's analogRead() and analogWrite() functions to read the humidity data from the sensor and change the temperature accordingly.
The temperatureControlPin and humiditySensorPin constants are defined as the pin numbers that the temperature control and humidity sensor are connected 
to, respectively.
The targetTemperature constant is the temperature that the system is trying to maintain. 
The temperatureChangePerHumidityUnit constant is used to determine how much the temperature should change for each unit of humidity.
The setup() function is called once at the beginning of the program and it sets the temperatureControlPin
